# Getting Started with Electronics

Electronics is a fascinating hobby and a rewarding career path. Whether you want to build your own gadgets, repair household items, or just understand how the world works, learning electronics is the first step.

## Essential Tools

To get started, you'll need a few basic tools:

1.  **Multimeter**: Essential for measuring voltage, current, and resistance.
2.  **Breadboard**: Used for prototyping circuits without soldering.
3.  **Jumper Wires**: To connect components on the breadboard.
4.  **Component Kit**: Resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and transistors.

## Your First Circuit

The "Hello World" of electronics is lighting up an LED. You'll need:
- A 9V Battery
- A generic LED
- A 470Ω Resistor

Connect the resistor in series with the LED to limit the current, and connect them to the battery. Voila! Light.
