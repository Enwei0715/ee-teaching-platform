# Arduino LED Chaser

This project is a classic for beginners. We will create a visual effect where LEDs light up in sequence, moving back and forth like the scanner on KITT from Knight Rider or the Cylons from Battlestar Galactica.

## How it Works

We will connect 5 LEDs to digital pins on the Arduino. By turning them on and off in a specific sequence with a small delay, we create the illusion of movement.

## Circuit Diagram

1.  Connect the **Cathode** (short leg) of each LED to the **Ground (GND)** rail on the breadboard.
2.  Connect the **Anode** (long leg) of each LED to a **220Ω resistor**.
3.  Connect the other end of each resistor to Arduino pins **2, 3, 4, 5, and 6**.
4.  Connect the **GND** pin from Arduino to the **Ground** rail.

## The Code

Upload the following code to your Arduino:

```cpp
int pins[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
int numPins = 5;
int delayTime = 100;

void setup() {
  for (int i = 0; i < numPins; i++) {
    pinMode(pins[i], OUTPUT);
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Move forward
  for (int i = 0; i < numPins; i++) {
    digitalWrite(pins[i], HIGH);
    delay(delayTime);
    digitalWrite(pins[i], LOW);
  }

  // Move backward
  for (int i = numPins - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    digitalWrite(pins[i], HIGH);
    delay(delayTime);
    digitalWrite(pins[i], LOW);
  }
}
```

## Challenges

Once you have it working, try these challenges:
1.  Change the speed of the animation.
2.  Add a potentiometer to control the speed dynamically.
3.  Create a "trail" effect where the LEDs fade out instead of turning off instantly.
