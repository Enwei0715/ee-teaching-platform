# Semiconductor Physics

## Intrinsic Semiconductors

Semiconductors are materials whose electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors and insulators. Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge) are the most common examples.

## Doping

Doping is the process of adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductors to alter their electrical properties.

*   **N-type**: Doped with pentavalent atoms (e.g., Phosphorus). Excess electrons.
*   **P-type**: Doped with trivalent atoms (e.g., Boron). Excess holes.
