# Boolean Algebra & Logic Gates

## Basic Logic Gates

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits.

*   **AND Gate**: Output is 1 only if all inputs are 1.
*   **OR Gate**: Output is 1 if at least one input is 1.
*   **NOT Gate**: Inverts the input (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0).

## Truth Tables

A truth table lists all possible input combinations and the corresponding output for a logic gate or circuit.
