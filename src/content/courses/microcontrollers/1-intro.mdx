# Introduction to Microcontrollers

## What is a Microcontroller?

A microcontroller (MCU) is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system. It includes a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals on a single chip.

## Microprocessor vs. Microcontroller

*   **Microprocessor**: CPU only (e.g., Intel Core i7). Requires external memory and I/O. Used in general-purpose computers.
*   **Microcontroller**: CPU + RAM + ROM + I/O. Self-contained. Used in appliances, cars, and gadgets.
