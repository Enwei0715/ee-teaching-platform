# Kirchhoff's Laws

Kirchhoff's laws are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference (commonly known as voltage) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits.

## Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)
The algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.
$$ \sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out} $$

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)
The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.
$$ \sum V = 0 $$
