# Introduction to Circuit Theory

Circuit theory is the foundation of electrical engineering. In this lesson, we will cover the basic concepts of voltage, current, and resistance.

## Voltage (V)
Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between two points. It is measured in Volts (V).

## Current (I)
Current is the rate of flow of electric charge past a point or region. It is measured in Amperes (A).

## Resistance (R)
Resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. It is measured in Ohms (Ω).

## Ohm's Law
The relationship between voltage, current, and resistance is defined by Ohm's Law:

$$ V = I \times R $$
