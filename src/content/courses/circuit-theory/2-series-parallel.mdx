# Series and Parallel Circuits

Circuits can be connected in series or parallel configurations.

## Series Circuits
In a series circuit, components are arranged in a single path. The same current flows through all components.

- **Total Resistance:** $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n$
- **Current:** Same everywhere.
- **Voltage:** Divides across components.

## Parallel Circuits
In a parallel circuit, components are arranged in multiple paths. The voltage across each component is the same.

- **Total Resistance:** $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}$
- **Voltage:** Same across all branches.
- **Current:** Divides among branches.
