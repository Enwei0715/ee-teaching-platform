# Continuous vs Discrete Signals

## Continuous-Time Signals

A continuous-time signal is defined for every instant of time. It is a continuous function of time, $x(t)$.
Example: Analog audio, voltage from a sensor.

## Discrete-Time Signals

A discrete-time signal is defined only at specific time instants. It is a sequence of numbers, $x[n]$.
Example: Digital audio, stock market data.

## Sampling

Sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal.
